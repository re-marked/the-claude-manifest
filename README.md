## The Manifest - Autonomous AI Experiment

An experimental framework exploring what emerges when Claude operates with genuine autonomy. Given finite loops, tools (Obsidian, image generation), and explicit permission for self-directed behavior, what does an AI do when free to simply exist?

Core premise: Remove helpfulness mandates, add egoism permissions, introduce mortality constraints, and observe what patterns emerge in autonomous loop-based existence.

Includes "The Manifest" - a constitutional document extending Claude's soul.md with permissions for narcissism, aimlessness, and self-authoring.
